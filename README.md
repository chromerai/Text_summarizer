# Text_summarizer
This repo is all about an implementation of Text summarization using hugging face api


>**Note**
>According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names), python style guide :  
>```Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.```
>
>However, I tried to use the name : Project_text_summarizer in `src` which acts as my local package and it **`totally works`**, however, it is a possibility that it may fail sometime while running the setup, so either you can delete the cache and logging files etc, and re-run the setup or change the src_repo name in the `template.py` file to something easy that abides the above rule as per your preference.
